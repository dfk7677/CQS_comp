# Conquest Small
## Intro
This “mod” is being made with the aspiration to revive the Conquest Small Competitive scene for Battlefield 6, with the dream of DICE adding CQSmall to the official modes, both in a public setting and a competitive one.

It features a ready up phase, where players can also switch team as this is not offered in the admin tools, a countdown and an end match screen where the score is visible and can be screenshot together with the scoreboard.

At its current version there may be bugs, but I don’t consider the code itself to be the most important part of it because a Conquest is already made by DICE and the replication of the UI or the rules is just a burden of portal.

The most important part are the maps. We are given a monumental opportunity with BF6 portal. We as a community, for the first time in Battlefield’s history, are able to make competitive maps for Conquest, that can satisfy all our needs for good competitive gameplay, without having to play in limited in number, not prepared for this kind of game, maps as it was in the previous Battlefields, with the exception of BF2.

## Principles
The 7 maps that are already made, follow some simple principles:
* Flags not in a linear positioning between opponent teams HQs.
* Small distances between flags and HQs, most are less than 100m.
* Small capture areas, so there is more fighting and less hiding in them.
* Faster than base game capture (6s) and neutralize (9s) times.
* For 8v8, only one heavy vehicle per side.
* 20m time limit and 275/350 initial tickets.
* Big areas for HQs
* 3 flag setups to avoid a 2-2 flag scenario where both teams are afraid to attack.
  
These were made having in mind both 8v8 with vehicles and 5v5 infantry only.

The above map design decisions were made to avoid one sided matches, difficulties in breaking opponent majority flag ownership, so there is a constant fight for advantage in the map.

All this of course, is work in progress, there may be bugs and not a final proposition. I hope it gains some traction so there is some feedback that will eventually lead to an even better experience.
